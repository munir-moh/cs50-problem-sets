"""In a file called figlet.py, implement a program that:

Expects zero or two command-line arguments:
-Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
-Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font, in which case the first of the two should be -f or --font, and the second of the two should be the name of the font.
Prompts the user for a str of text.
Outputs that text in the desired font.
If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not -f or --font or the second is not the name of a font, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message."""
