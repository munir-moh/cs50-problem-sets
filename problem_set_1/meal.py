"""Implement a program that prompts the user for a time and outputs whether it’s breakfast time, lunch time, or dinner time. 
If it’s not time for a meal, don’t output anything at all. Assume that the user’s input will be formatted in 24-hour time as #:## or ##:##. 
And assume that each meal’s time range is inclusive. For instance, whether it’s 7:00, 7:01, 7:59, or 8:00, or anytime in between, it’s time for breakfast.

Structure your program per the below, wherein convert is a function (that can be called by main) that converts time, a str in 24-hour format, to the corresponding number of hours as a float. 
For instance, given a time like "7:30" (i.e., 7 hours and 30 minutes), convert should return 7.5 (i.e., 7.5 hours).

def main():
    ...


def convert(time):
    ...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
